# [packwiz-installer](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer)

This package allows you to use packwiz installer without the [bootstrapper](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap).
This is NOT the intended way to use this program, hence don't report issues upstream.

I used some code from the [mindustry package](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/games/mindustry/default.nix).

> [!WARNING]
> Right now this is a complete hack but it works. It'll be better (or at least up with the standard of other gradle apps in nixpkgs) when I figure out how to get [./proper.nix](./proper.nix) to build
