# Apple Fonts

This package contains Apple fonts from [https://developer.apple.com/fonts/](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

The derivation is mostly taken from [this gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robbins/dccf1238e971973a6a963b04c486c099/raw/08b77ef234a7fc44c34470de06f6d6ce25020255/apple-fonts.nix) and adapted a little.

I have no clue about the license of this.
